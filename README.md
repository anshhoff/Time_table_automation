## Overview
The **Automated Timetable Scheduler** is a comprehensive Java-based project designed to generate optimized and conflict-free timetables for academic institutions. Using **OptaPlanner**, the project ensures that all scheduling constraints are met while balancing faculty workloads, student requirements, and room availability. This project emphasizes the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and advanced Java techniques, providing a robust foundation for solving real-world scheduling problems.

## Key Features

- **Constraint-Based Optimization**: Leverages OptaPlanner to solve scheduling problems with hard and soft constraints.
- **Support for Diverse Entities**: Includes Courses, Faculties, Student Batches, Rooms, Lessons, and Time Slots.
- **Enhanced Room Types**: Handles various room types such as lecture rooms, computer labs, and hardware labs.
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Supports minor courses and ensures their compatibility with time slots and rooms.
- **Balanced Workload**: Ensures equitable distribution of teaching hours among faculty.
- **Conflict-Free Schedules**: Avoids overlapping sessions for faculty, rooms, and student batches.
- **CSV Integration**: Enables easy data import/export for courses, faculty, rooms, and schedules.

## Data Loading
**CSVDataLoader** provides utility methods for importing data:

- `loadFaculty(String csvFile)`
- `loadRooms(String csvFile)`
- `loadCourses(String csvFile, List<Faculty> facultyList)`
- `loadStudentBatches(String csvFile, List<Course> courseList)`

---

## Usage

1. **Set Up Data**: Prepare CSV files for faculties, rooms, courses, and student batches.
2. **Run Solver**:
    ```java
    SolverFactory<TimeTable> solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(new SolverConfig());
    TimeTable solution = solver.solve(problem);
    ```
3. **Export Solution**: Save the generated timetable to a CSV file.
